          Learning resources are texts, videos, software, and other materials
          that teachers use to assist students to meet expectations for learning
          as defined by the provincial curricula. A quality learning resource
          has to fit the curriculum and meet expectations for learning keeping
          social considerations, and age/developmental appropriateness in mind.
          In this age of technological advancement learning and teaching
          resources are not confined to a mere textbook. There are now
          diversified web-based learning materials, computer-based learning,
          structured coursework and audio-visual teaching aids. <br />
          <br />
          In fact, video tutorials amplify learning and increase student
          engagement, which in turn helps boost creativity and the desire to
          achieve great heights. Most importantly, if students are interested in
          the material, they will process and remember it better. Digital videos
          also facilitate remote learning opportunities so that teachers can
          reach students from all over the world.

          In this digital age, students use educational videos for learning
          abstract topics as well as tedious steps pf mathematical calculations.
          Topics that once seemed difficult to teach and learn are now more
          accessible and understandable thanks to the availability of
          educational videos for online learning. <br />
          <br />
          Studies have shown that the use of short video clips allows for more
          efficient processing and memory recall. The visual and auditory nature
          of videos appeals to a wide audience and allows each user to process
          information in a way that’s natural to them. In a nutshell, videos are
          good teachers.
